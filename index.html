            <h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>
            <p>
                In this course, I made enhancements to the Inventory app created in CS-360 - Mobile Architect and Programming. Most of these enhancements were changes that I would have liked to add in the original project but ran out of time before having to turn it in. 
                With each enhancement, I tried to improve the code that was already present rather than replacing it. When working with a team, if something had to be updated, it would be disrespectful to remove the work someone else had done just to replace it with something similar created by you. 
                With that in mind, I kept the original code that could be salvaged and replaced the parts that no longer fit. I wanted to continue my work with Kotlin mainly because I am less familiar with it. I have a much stronger skillset when it comes to Python which is why I decided not to work on a Python project. 
                I would prefer to improve an area that I know less about than layer more of the same on top of a strength. I never expected to enjoy a rebuild of a completed project as much as I did, but I suppose that is not the best way to look at it. If something can be improved, it will never be completed so much as steadily improving.
                <br><br>
                The first enhancement that I made in this project was replacing the toast messages with snackbar messages. From the beginning, I felt that the toast messages looked like they were coming from the device and not the app, so I wanted to create a more common theme. This was also demonstrated in the first update to the color scheme done in this enhancement. 
                I also incorporated a separate screen for the user account creation rather than keeping it all on the login screen. The second enhancement included comments throughout the project that had been left out previously and implementing the update function for the inventory items in the database. 
                Finally, I decided to improve the security of the app by hashing passwords as accounts are created using the SHA-256 hashing system. Along with the security update, I also decided to redesign the app with a cleaner look and a card system for inventory items.

            <h2>Enhancement One - Update App Messages</h2>
            <h4><a href="https://github.com/Jon-Marvin/CS-499/tree/main/CS-499%20-%20Module%203%20Enhancement">First Enhancement</a></h4>
            <p>
                The artifact that I will be enhancing through this course is the Inventory App from CS 360 Mobile Architect and Programming. This app is used to hold inventory data for a small warehouse or for personal use, being that it does not have any kind of messaging or internet capability. It was created in April of 2025 during my most recent term at SNHU. I wanted to include this project in my ePortfolio because I felt that I had accomplished something that I had not expected to. I had never even heard of Android Studio or Kotlin before taking that class, so the fact that I was able to accomplish a fully functional app in eight short weeks felt amazing. The app is far from perfect; some of the code that I had added was completely unutilized, but this first enhancement has brought a lot of new life to it.<br><br>
	The first enhancement that I wanted to add to the app was some kind of color scheme. Rather than leaving it as a black and white bore, I added a dark blue background and changed the text to white. This small change made the app look significantly better and feel more like an actual piece of inventory software that a company would use. Next, I wanted to make the pop-up messages blend better with the new theme of the app, so I replaced all of the Toast messages with snackbar messages. Using snackbar, I was able to change the color and font color to something similar to the blue and white theme that I had employed in the enhancement. I decided to make the blue in the snackbar messages a little bit darker than the background color so it would be noticeable. Finally, I updated the “Create Account” button to bring the user to a new screen and setup their account credentials rather than doing it the same way they would log in.<br><br>
	I feel the outcomes that I touched on the best with these updates were two and four. The second outcome was accomplished by giving a clearer view of the messages displayed by the app. With the Toast messages, it almost looked like the phone was sending errors when something in the app happened. The new setup shows clearly that the app is sending messages. I accomplished the fourth outcome with the updated account creation screen. I had a problem with the way users were creating accounts. This was a problem I had created in the first place, and I aimed to fix it. By giving the account creation method its own script and layout, I was able to solve that problem.<br><br>
	The first thing I learned during the first enhancement is that the easy way is not always the best way. I had to make a major decision about how I wanted to update the app according to the course guidelines because I changed my plans at the last minute. I had originally planned to remake my scene from CS 330 using AutoCAD, but since that was not part of my learning at SNHU, I felt it was inappropriate to pursue. The decision came down to moving enhancements planned for later modules up and finding something else to tackle when I get there. For the next enhancement, I plan to incorporate the currently unused update method into the app to give the user the ability to update the items that they have added to the inventory. I also want to start adding comments to the code to improve readability and add a location parameter for easier storing and finding items in the inventory. One major challenge I had, and I was lucky to discover, was login credentials not working correctly. 
    I had finished the create account page and wanted to login to the newly created account when I accidentally clicked “Login” before entering anything in the field. Unfortunately, it logged me in. I had left out the clause to block any empty credentials and had to revisit that. After that was completed, I realized that I had left out credential validation. I mistyped my password and it still logged me in. This taught me more than anything that I need to try to break my app so I can find all of the bugs that I may have missed.

            <h2>Enhancement Two - Include Update Function</h2>
            <h4><a href="https://github.com/Jon-Marvin/CS-499/tree/main/CS-499%20-%20Module%204%20Enhancement">Second Enhancement</a></h4>
            <p>
                The artifact I decided to enhance for the Algorithms and Data Structure portion of the project was also the CS-370 Mobile Architect and Programming Inventory app. There were certain aspects of the project that I was unhappy with when I turned it in. I had completed all of the requirements before submission, but a few things that I had run out of time on stuck out in my head.<br><br>
	For this enhancement, I wanted to cover a few of the small things that I had missed. First, I wanted to add comments in each script. It is best practice to include comments for an easier read, and I had left them out in the original iteration. I wanted to loop back at the end to add them, but by the time I was finished, I had just wanted to turn in the project. This Capstone project gave me a chance to correct that oversight. The other major issue that I had left out of the original iteration was the update function. Inventory for companies can both increase and decrease, and having items recur multiple times in the app would be inefficient and, frankly, ugly. I decided to add an update button beside items in the inventory so quantities could be changed rather than having to delete and recreate an entry.<br><br>
	When making this enhancement, I was hoping to cover course outcomes one and three. For outcome one, adding comments allows coworkers or teams to QA and update each other’s work. Rather than having only one person who knows how to change the code, anyone can look at the comments and find what they need to make the necessary changes. Outcome three was completed by solving the problem that I had created originally with no update method. Though the function was in the script, it had not been called anywhere and thus could not be used. By calling the update function in InventoryAdapter.kt, I was able to add the button and a dialog box to change the quantities of items. This feature is definitely an improvement over deleting and recreating entries to change quantities.<br><br>
	The main thing I learned in this enhancement is that adding comments to finished projects is difficult. Due to my inexperience with Kotlin, and Java in general, I had to fully reread each block of code to add the comments when I could have just added them as I created the project in the first place. Getting the update function working took longer than I had anticipated. I had to run through it multiple times before I was able to get the button to respond. After about an hour of trial and error and the app crashing continuously, the button responded only for the update dialog box to crash the app. I got it to a working state, and for that, I am grateful.

            <h2>Enhancement Three - Hash Passwords</h2>
            <h4><a href="https://github.com/Jon-Marvin/CS-499/tree/main/CS-499%20-%20Module%205%20Enhancement">Third Enhancement</a></h4>
            <p>
                For the final enhancement, I continued my work in the CS-370 Mobile Architect and Programming Inventory app. I had some trouble deciding on how to enhance the database, but I decided not to go in the original direction that I had planned. The original plan was to create an option to “add many” so users could fill the inventory with a few less clicks, but that has less to do with databases and more to do with user interface quality of life.<br><br>
	The database enhancement that I decided to make was hashing the saved passwords for better security and stronger database storage. I also updated the look of the app and the inventory screen with a more appealing color scheme and a card-based inventory system, but the main focus of this enhancement is the database. Rather than saving the passwords in the database and moving on, I decided it would be best to secure passwords in case of an attack. That way, hackers would have a more difficult time stealing information from the app database. Though personal information was not added to the app, inventory can be sensitive, so hashing the passwords was the best option. <br><br>
	As mentioned in the above paragraph, a big focus of this enhancement was security. The fifth course outcome was one that I was unsure if I was going to touch on, so I was happy to come up with the idea of hashing passwords. The original plan for the final enhancement was covering course outcomes two and three, and with the work that was done, I feel they were also brought into this enhancement, but outcome five was the most prevalent. Now, when logging in, the input password is hashed and compared to the saved password in the database. I had a lot of fun with this enhancement, especially when trying to find a style that I liked. 
    Hashing passwords is something that I learned about in CS-305 Software Security, so I used the same SHA-256 hashing that I had used in that class. Figuring out how to apply it to Kotlin took some time and a lot of reading. Stack overflow was my best friend during this enhancement.
