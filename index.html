            <h2>Enhancement 1</h2>
            <p>
                The artifact that I will be enhancing through this course is the Inventory App from CS 360 – Mobile Architect and Programming. This app is used to hold inventory data for a small warehouse or for personal use, being that it does not have any kind of messaging or internet capability. It was created in April of 2025 during my most recent term at SNHU. I wanted to include this project in my ePortfolio because I felt that I had accomplished something that I had not expected to. I had never even heard of Android Studio or Kotlin before taking that class, so the fact that I was able to accomplish a fully functional app in eight short weeks felt amazing. The app is far from perfect; some of the code that I had added was completely unutilized, but this first enhancement has brought a lot of new life to it. 
	The first enhancement that I wanted to add to the app was some kind of color scheme. Rather than leaving it as a black and white bore, I added a dark blue background and changed the text to white. This small change made the app look significantly better and feel more like an actual piece of inventory software that a company would use. Next, I wanted to make the pop-up messages blend better with the new theme of the app, so I replaced all of the Toast messages with snackbar messages. Using snackbar, I was able to change the color and font color to something similar to the blue and white theme that I had employed in the enhancement. I decided to make the blue in the snackbar messages a little bit darker than the background color so it would be noticeable. Finally, I updated the “Create Account” button to bring the user to a new screen and setup their account credentials rather than doing it the same way they would log in.
	I feel the outcomes that I touched on the best with these updates were two and four. The second outcome was accomplished by giving a clearer view of the messages displayed by the app. With the Toast messages, it almost looked like the phone was sending errors when something in the app happened. The new setup shows clearly that the app is sending messages. I accomplished the fourth outcome with the updated account creation screen. I had a problem with the way users were creating accounts. This was a problem I had created in the first place, and I aimed to fix it. By giving the account creation method its own script and layout, I was able to solve that problem.
	The first thing I learned during the first enhancement is that the easy way is not always the best way. I had to make a major decision about how I wanted to update the app according to the course guidelines because I changed my plans at the last minute. I had originally planned to remake my scene from CS 330 using AutoCAD, but since that was not part of my learning at SNHU, I felt it was inappropriate to pursue. The decision came down to moving enhancements planned for later modules up and finding something else to tackle when I get there. For the next enhancement, I plan to incorporate the currently unused update method into the app to give the user the ability to update the items that they have added to the inventory. I also want to start adding comments to the code to improve readability and add a location parameter for easier storing and finding items in the inventory. One major challenge I had, and I was lucky to discover, was login credentials not working correctly. 
    I had finished the create account page and wanted to login to the newly created account when I accidentally clicked “Login” before entering anything in the field. Unfortunately, it logged me in. I had left out the clause to block any empty credentials and had to revisit that. After that was completed, I realized that I had left out credential validation. I mistyped my password and it still logged me in. This taught me more than anything that I need to try to break my app so I can find all of the bugs that I may have missed.
